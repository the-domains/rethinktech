description: "The teaser video, embedded for the sake of it existing, includes a guy decked out in Samsung's Gear VR headset. Maybe there will be some virtual reality features? Or maybe you'll be able to gaze at the launch event in full 360-degree vision -- if you've got Gear VR and a compatible (soon to be obsolete) smartphone."
