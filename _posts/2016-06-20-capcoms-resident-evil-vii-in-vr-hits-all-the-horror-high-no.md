  It's just a game. This is what I told myself, repeatedly, as I experienced the
  Resident Evil series in virtual reality for the first time. It was just a
  game, it couldn't hurt me. I wasn't really in a creepy, decrepit old
  farmhouse-just in a press demo room that happened to be modeled after the
  rooms in said creepy house.
