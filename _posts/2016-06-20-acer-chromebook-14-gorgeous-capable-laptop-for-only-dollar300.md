  Not many Chromebooks can be called beautiful. Affordable? Sure. Portable?
  Often. But Chromebooks are almost exclusively budget systems, and design often
  falls by the wayside. Google tried to change preceptions with its Chromebook
  Pixel, but nobody wanted to pay $1,300 for a Chromebook, however nice it may
  be.
