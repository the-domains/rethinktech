  Graphics specialist NVIDIA introduced its very first ultra-high-end gaming
  graphics card under the branding of "Titan" back in early 2013. The part was
  introduced at an eye-popping $999 price point, but reports at the time
  suggested that the card actually sold well -- at the very least, better than
  the company expected.
