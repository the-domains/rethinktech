description: "Eldon asked whether he should upgrade to Windows 10. My short answer: If you're using Windows 8.1, probably yes. If you're using Windows 7, probably no. But of course it's much more complicated than that. Last July, I recommended that people wait at least three months before accepting Microsoft's free upgrade."
