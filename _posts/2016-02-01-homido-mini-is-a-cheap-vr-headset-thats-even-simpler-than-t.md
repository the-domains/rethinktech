description: "The Homido Mini is a small, easy to use, and extremely portable virtual reality 'headset' for mobile devices that works with apps that support Google Cardboard. It's reasonably cheap, and you can use it to very easily showcase VR experiences without having to carry around a large boxy cardboard headset, which makes it a great buy if you're interested in virtual reality."
