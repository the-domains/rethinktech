description: "As 2016 kicked off, the Rumor Mill saw fit to start gracing us with even more reports on Apple's next flagship smartphones, what are expected to be called the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Some of the rumors are recycled stories from past devices, like added water resistance, and better batteries, but some of them are wholly unique, and certainly eye catching."
