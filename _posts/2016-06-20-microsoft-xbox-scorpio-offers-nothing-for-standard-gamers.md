  We know that the Xbox Scorpio exists, we know that it's much more powerful
  than the Xbox One, but we don't know a whole lot else. Microsoft's decision to
  announce this far in advance was a bit surprising to some, but it's always
  nice to see cracks in that wall of silence that too often defines the video
  game industry.
