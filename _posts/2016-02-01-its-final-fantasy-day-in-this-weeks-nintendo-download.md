description: "This week in the Nintendo Download, it's a double-dose of old-school Final Fantasy gameplay, one classic, one new. Final Fantasy Explorers is a throwback title where you master job classes and defeat monsters with summons, just as in the early titles from the FF series...but there are a few new additions, such as the ability to recruit the monsters you find to fight for your side."
