            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why upgrading to Windows 10 is less alarming than it used to be</h1><p>Eldon asked whether he should upgrade to Windows 10. My short answer: If you're using Windows 8.1, probably yes. If you're using Windows 7, probably no. But of course it's much more complicated than that. Last July, I recommended that people wait at least three months before accepting Microsoft's free upgrade.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5be43a2e03fcbb497db511430d0d3f40a999dd86.png"></article>]]></description>
